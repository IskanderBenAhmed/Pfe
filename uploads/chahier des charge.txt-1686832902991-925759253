Why JWT : JWTs are a good way of securely transmitting information between parties 
because they can be signed, which means you can be certain that the senders are who they 
say they are. Additionally, the structure of a JWT allows you to verify that the 
content hasn't been tampered with.

JWTs enable faster authorization and more interoperability with external apps, 
but they demand more developer investment to address their security complexities, 
and might not be the best fit for applications that enable access to sensitive 
data or actions.

The main difference between API Key auth and JWT token auth is that the JWT Token 
is self-contained - the information asserted by the token is in the token. 
Whereas with an API Key the asserted information is stored in an external system.
